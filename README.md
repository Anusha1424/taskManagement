After cloning the project from git url, we have two different directories for frontend and backend
To run backend:

-->open terminal in project root directory and change to backend directory i.e., cd backend
-->Install node modules using npm install
-->Run backend service using npm run serve
this will start backend server at 9000 port

To run front end:
-->open terminal in project root directory and change to frontend directory i.e., cd frontend
-->Install node modules using npm install
-->Run frontend service using npm run dev
this will start front end at 3000 port.

It will run our project on http://localhost:3000
